# RestfulRider
This repository contains the code I am using to build the RestfulRider Android application. It is currently a work in progress.

**What is RestfulRider?**
The RestfulRider app (*RRA*) is a project to create a lightweight Android application that assists commuters using the 
GO rail network in the Greater Toronto Area. Mainly, the aim of the project is to create an improved GO client experience.

**What will RRA offer?**
At the moment, the primary focus for the RRA is to introduce a push-notification functionality that allows users to be notified
when their rail station of choice is approaching. To do this, the app will leverage Android GPS functionality, while staying 
as lightweight and simple as possible.

**Is this app ready to be used?**
For the time being, no. The RRA is very much a work in progress, but when the app is ready for public use it will be imported
to the Google Play Store, and this project will be reoriented to introducing additional functionality and app maintenance.
To stay up to date, look for updates on the project on my GitHub!
